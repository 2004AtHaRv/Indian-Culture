<h2 id="Ancient-History">Ancient History</h2>

<p>India's history and culture is dynamic, spanning back to the beginning of human civilization. It begins with a
    mysterious culture along the Indus River and in farming communities in the southern lands of India. The history of
    India is punctuated by constant integration of migrating people with the diverse cultures that surround India.
    Available evidence suggests that the use of iron, copper and other metals was widely prevalent in the Indian
    sub-continent at a fairly early period, which is indicative of the progress that this part of the world had made. By
    the end of the fourth millennium BC, India had emerged as a region of highly developed civilization.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>The Indus Valley Civilization</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/12856.jpg" alt="The Indus Valley Civilization" style="margin: 40px;">
<p>The History of India begins with the birth of the Indus Valley Civilization, more precisely known as Harappan
    Civilization. It flourished around 2,500 BC, in the western part of South Asia, what today is Pakistan and Western
    India. The Indus Valley was home to the largest of the four ancient urban civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India
    and China. Nothing was known about this civilization till 1920s when the Archaeological Department of India carried
    out excavations in the Indus valley wherein the ruins of the two old cities, viz. Mohenjodaro and Harappa were
    unearthed. The ruins of buildings and other things like household articles, weapons of war, gold and silver
    ornaments, seals, toys, pottery wares, etc., show that some four to five thousand years ago a highly developed
    Civilization flourished in this region.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Indus valley civilization was basically an urban civilization and the people lived in well-planned and
    well-built towns, which were also the centers for trade. The ruins of Mohenjodaro and Harappa show that these were
    magnificent merchant cities-well planned, scientifically laid, and well looked after. They had wide roads and a
    well-developed drainage system. The houses were made of baked bricks and had two or more storeys.
    <br>
    <br>
    The highly civilized Harappans knew the art of growing cereals, and wheat and barley constituted their staple food.
    They consumed vegetables and fruits and ate mutton, pork and eggs as well. Evidences also show that they wore cotton
    as well as woollen garments. By 1500 BC, the Harappan culture came to an end. Among various causes ascribed to the
    decay of Indus Valley Civilization are the recurrent floods and other natural causes like earthquake, etc.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Vedic Civilization</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/thevediccivilization-180410175422-thumbnail-4.jpg" alt="Vedic Civilization"
    style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 200px;">
<p>The Vedic civilization is the earliest civilization in the history of ancient India. It is named after the Vedas, the
    early literature of the Hindu people. The Vedic Civilization flourished along the river Saraswati, in a region that
    now consists of the modern Indian states of Haryana and Punjab. Vedic is synonymous with Hinduism, which is another
    name for religious and spiritual thought that has evolved from the Vedas.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Ramayana and Mahabharata were the two great epics of this period.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Buddhist Era</h3>

<p>During the life time of Lord Gautam Buddha, sixteen great powers (Mahajanpadas) existed in the 7th and early 6th
    centuries BC. Among the more important republics were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and the Licchavis of Vaishali.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Alexander's Invasion</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/170px-Alexander_the_Great,_from_Alexandria,_Egypt,_3rd_cent._BCE,_Ny_Carlsberg_Glyptotek,_Copenhagen_(5)_(36375553176).jpg"
    alt="Alexander's Invasion" style="margin: 40px;">
<p>In 326 BC, Alexander invaded India, after crossing the river Indus he advanced towards Taxila. He then challenged
    king Porus , ruler of the kingdom between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab. The Indians were defeated in the fierce
    battle, even though they fought with elephants, which the Macedonians had never before seen. Alexander captured
    Porus and, like the other local rulers he had defeated, allowed him to continue to govern his territory.
    During this trip to rivers Hydaspes and Indus in the south, Alexander sought out the Indian philosophers, the
    Brahmins, who were famous for their wisdom, and debated with them on philosophical issues. He became legendary for
    centuries in India for being both, a wise philosopher and a fearless conqueror.
    <br>
    <br>
    One of the villages in which the army halted belonged to the Mallis, who were said to be one of the most warlike of
    the Indian tribes. Alexander was wounded several times in this attack, most seriously when an arrow pierced his
    breastplate and his ribcage. The Macedonian officers rescued him in a narrow escape from the village.
    <br>
    <br>
    Alexander and his army reached the mouth of the Indus in July 325 BC, and turned westward for home.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Gupta Dynasty</h3>
<p>After the Kushanas, the Guptas were the most important dynasty. The Gupta period has been described as the Golden Age
    of Indian history. The first famous king of the Gupta dynasty was Ghatotkacha's son Chandragupta I. He married
    Kumaradevi, the daughter of the chief of the Licchavis. This marriage was a turning point in the life of
    Chandragupta I. He got Pataliputra in dowry from the Lichhavis. From Pataliputra, he laid the foundation of his
    empire and started conquering many neighbouring states with the help of the Licchavis. He ruled over Magadha
    (Bihar), Prayaga and Saketa (east Uttar Pradesh). His kingdom extended from the river Ganges to Allahabad.
    Chandragupta I also got the title of Maharajadhiraja (King of Kings) and ruled for about fifteen years.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Harshavardhana</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/harshavardhana-4.jpg" alt="Harshavardhana" style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 240px;">
<p>With the commencement of the 7th century, Harshavardhana (606-647 A.D.) ascended the throne of Thaneshwar and Kannauj
    on the death of his brother, Rajyavardhana. By 612 Harshavardhana consolidated his kingdom in northern India.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 620 A.D. Harshavardhana invaded the Chalukya kingdom in the Deccan, which was then ruled by Pulakesin II. But the
    Chalukya resistance proved tough for Harshavardhana and he was defeated. Harshavardhana is well known for his
    religious toleration, able administration and diplomatic relations. He maintained diplomatic relations with China
    and sent envoys, who exchanged ideas of the Chinese rulers and developed their knowledge about each other.</p>

<h2 id="Medieval-History">Medieval History</h2>

<p>For a period that has come to be so strongly associated with the Islamic influence and rule in India, Medieval Indian
    history went for almost three whole centuries under the so-called indigenous rulers, that included the Chalukyas,
    the Pallavas, the Pandyas, the Rashtrakutas, the Muslims rulers and finally the Mughal Empire. The most important
    dynasty to emerge in the middle of the 9th century was that of the Cholas.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Palas</h3>
<p>Between 8th and 10th centuries A.D., a number of powerful empires dominated the eastern and northern parts of India.
    The Pala king Dharmpala, son of Gopala reigned from the late 8th century A.D. to early 9th century A.D. Nalanda
    University and Vikramashila University were founded by Dharmpala.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>The Senas</h3>
<p>After the decline of the Palas, the Sena dynasty established its rule in Bengal. The founder of the dynasty was
    Samantasena. The greatest ruler of the dynasty was Vijaysena. He conquered the whole of Bengal and was succeeded by
    his son Ballalasena. He reigned peacefully but kept his dominions intact. He was a great scholar and wrote four
    works including one on astronomy. The last ruler of this dynasty was Lakshamanasena under whose reign the Muslims
    invaded Bengal, and the empire fell.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Pratihara</h3>
<p>The greatest ruler of the Pratihara dynasty was Mihir Bhoja. He recovered Kanauj (Kanyakubja) by 836, and it remained
    the capital of the Pratiharas for almost a century. He built the city Bhojpal (Bhopal). Raja Bhoja and other valiant
    Gujara kings faced and defeated many attacks of the Arabs from west.
    <br><br>
    Between 915-918 A.D, Kanauj was attacked by a Rashtrakuta king, who devastated the city leading to the weakening of
    the Pratihara Empire. In 1018, Kannauj then ruled by Rajyapala Pratihara was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni. The empire
    broke into independent Rajput states.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Rashtrakutas</h3>
<p>This dynasty, which ruled from Karnataka, is illustrious for several reasons. They ruled the territory vaster than
    that of any other dynasty. They were great patrons of art and literature. The encouragement that several Rashtrakuta
    kings provided to education and literature is unique, and the religious tolerance exercised by them was exemplary.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Chola Empire of the South</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/406px-South_India_in_early_11th_century_AD.jpg" alt="The Chola Empire of the South"
    style="margin: 40px; width: 400px; height: 360px;">
<p>It emerged in the middle of the 9th century A.D., covered a large part of Indian peninsula, as well as parts of Sri
    Lanka and the Maldives Islands.
    <br><br>
    The first important ruler to emerge from the dynasty was Rajaraja Chola I and his son and successor Rajendra Chola.
    Rajaraja carried forward the annexation policy of his father. He led armed expedition to distant lands of Bengal,
    Odisha and Madhya Pradesh.
    <br><br>
    The successors of Rajendra I, Rajadhiraj and Rajendra II were brave rulers who fought fiercely against the later
    Chalukya kings, but could not check the decline of Chola Empire. The later Chola kings were weak and incompetent
    rulers. The Chola Empire thus lingered on for another century and a half, and finally came to an end with the
    invasion of Malik Kafur in the early 14th century A.D.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Rise of Islam in South-Asia</h3>
<p>The initial entry of Islam into South Asia came in the first century after the death of the Prophet Muhammad. The
    Umayyad caliph in Damascus sent an expedition to Baluchistan and Sindh in 711 led by Muhammad bin Qasim. He captured
    Sindh and Multan. Three hundred years after his death Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, the ferocious leader, led a series of
    raids against Rajput kingdoms and rich Hindu temples, and established a base in Punjab for future incursions. In
    1024, the Sultan set out on his last famous expedition to the southern coast of Kathiawar along the Arabian Sea,
    where he sacked the city of Somnath and its renowned Hindu temple.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Timur's Invasion</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/download (5).jpg" alt="Timur's Invasion" style="margin: 40px; width: 400px; height: 400px;">
<p>Timur, better known as, Taimur was given the title of ‘Taimur Lang’, because his one leg got wound in the battlefield
    and compelled the Taimur to walk with a limp. Taimur was an invader from Central Asia who dreamt of becoming the
    famous conquerors of the world.
    After conquering the Central Asian belt he now rested his eyes on The Golden Bird ie.India, which he keenly wanted
    to plunder and masquerade.
    <br><br>
    He recklessly plundered the country, thus causing brutal massacres, looting and dishonor of women so much so that
    the people decided to get their daughters and sisters married at very early ages.
    <br><br>
    Timur’s invasions were nothing but an evil mind not being put to rest. His mindless passions and wrong psychology
    resulted in a long term failures, that took time to come back to normal.
    <br><br>
    Timur destroyed hundreds of beautiful buildings and temples just to loot the wealth. After the attack of Timur,
    India was drained of all the finances and was on the peak of economic disaster. His army ruined and burnt the
    standing crops, unattended dead bodies and destruction led to outbreak of diseases and shortage of food. The effect
    of his invasion was so strong that no Tughlaq ruler regained the lost strength to come back on throne. The country
    was on the verge of total breakdown.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Vijayanagar Empire</h3>
<p>When Muhammad Tughlaq was losing his power in Deccan, the two Hindu princes, Harihar and Bukka founded an independent
    kingdom in the region between the river Krishna and Tungabhadra in 1336. They soon established their sway over the
    entire territory between the rivers Krishna in the north and Cauveri in the south. The rising powers of the
    Vijayanagar empire brought it into clash with many powers and they frequently fought wars with the Bahmani kingdom.
</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Bhakti Movement</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/download (6).jpg" alt="Bhakti Movement" style="margin: 40px; width: 240px; height: 200px;">
<p>An important landmark in the cultural history of medieval India was the silent revolution in society brought about by
    a galaxy of socio-religious reformers, a revolution known as the Bhakti Movement. This movement was responsible for
    many rites and rituals associated with the worship of God by Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs of Indian subcontinent. For
    example, Kirtan at a Hindu Temple, Qawaali at a Dargah (by Muslims), and singing of Gurbani at a Gurdwara are all
    derived from the Bhakti movement of medieval India (800-1700). The leader of this Hindu revivalist movement was
    Shankaracharya, a great thinker and a distinguished philosopher. And this movement was propounded by Chaitanya
    Mahaprabhu, Namadeva, Tukaram, Jayadeva. The movement's major achievement was its abolition of idol worship.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Mughal Empire</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/1daeb98aa2aae28450c1c35c1501325b.jpg" alt="The Mughal Empire"
    style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 180px;">
<p>In India, the Mughal Empire was one of the greatest empires ever. The Mughal Empire ruled hundreds of millions of
    people. India became united under one rule, and had very prosperous cultural and political years during the Mughal
    rule. There were many Muslim and Hindu kingdoms split all throughout India until the founders of the Mughal Empire
    came. There were some men such as Babar, grandson to the Great Asian conqueror Tamerlane and the conqueror Genghis
    Khan from the northern region of Ganges, river valley, who decided to take over Khyber, and eventually, all of
    India.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Rise of the Sikh Power</h3>
<p>Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak Dev at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Guru Nanak was born on April 15,
    1469 in the Western Punjab village of Talwandi. Even as a child, he was given to deep thinking with no interest in
    worldly life. At the age of thirty, he got enlightenment. Thereafter, he travelled almost the whole of the country
    and went over to Mecca and Baghdad, preaching his message. On his death he was followed by nine other Gurus in
    succession.</p>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<h2 id="Freedom-Struggle">Freedom Struggle</h2>
<p>In ancient times, people from all over the world were keen to come to India. The Persians followed by the Iranians
    and Parsis immigrated to India. Then came the Moghuls and they too settled down permanently in India. Chengis Khan,
    the Mongolian, invaded and looted India many times. Alexander the Great too, came to conquer India but went back
    after a battle with Porus. He-en Tsang from China came in pursuit of knowledge and to visit the ancient Indian
    universities of Nalanda and Takshila. Columbus wanted to come to India, but instead landed on the shores of America.
    Vasco da Gama from Portugal came to trade his country's goods in return for Indian spices. The French came and
    established their colonies in India.
    <br><br>
    Lastly, the Britishers came and ruled over India for nearly 200 years. After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the
    British achieved political power in India. And their paramountcy was established during the tenure of Lord
    Dalhousie, who became the Governor- General in 1848. He annexed Punjab, Peshawar and the Pathan tribes in the
    north-west of India. And by 1856, the British conquest and its authority were firmly established. And while the
    British power gained its heights during the middle of the 19th century, the discontent of the local rulers, the
    peasantry, the intellectuals, common masses as also of the soldiers who became unemployed due to the disbanding of
    the armies of various states that were annexed by the British, became widespread. This soon broke out into a revolt
    which assumed the dimensions of the 1857 Mutiny.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Indian Mutiny of 1857</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/17painting1.jpg" alt="The Indian Mutiny of 1857" style="margin: 40px; width: 720px; height: 400px;">
<p>
    The conquest of India, which could be said to have begun with the Battle of Plassey (1757), was practically
    completed by the end of Dalhousie's tenure in 1856. It had been by no means a smooth affair as the simmering
    discontent of the people manifested itself in many localized revolt during this period. However, the Mutiny of 1857,
    which began with a revolt of the military soldiers at Meerut, soon became widespread and posed a grave challenge to
    the British rule. Even though the British succeeded in crushing it within a year, it was certainly a popular revolt
    in which the Indian rulers, the masses and the militia participated so enthusiastically that it came to be regarded
    as the First War of Indian Independence.
    <br><br>
    Introduction of zamindari system by the British, where the peasants were ruined through exorbitant charges made from
    them by the new class of landlords. The craftsmen were destroyed by the influx of the British manufactured goods.
    The religion and the caste system which formed the firm foundation of the traditional Indian society was endangered
    by the British administration. The Indian soldiers as well as people in administration could not rise in hierarchy
    as the senior jobs were reserved for the Europeans. Thus, there was all-round discontent and disgust against the
    British rule, which burst out in a revolt by the 'sepoys' at Meerut whose religious sentiments were offended when
    they were given new cartridges greased with cow and pig fat, whose covering had to be stripped out by biting with
    the mouth before using them in rifles. The Hindu as well as the Muslim soldiers, who refused to use such cartridges,
    were arrested which resulted in a revolt by their fellow soldiers on May 9, 1857.
    <br><br>
    The rebel forces soon captured Delhi and the revolt spread to a wider area and there was uprising in almost all
    parts of the country. The most ferocious battles were fought in Delhi, Awadh, Rohilkhand, Bundelkhand, Allahabad,
    Agra, Meerut and western Bihar. The rebellious forces under the commands of Kanwar Singh in Bihar and Bakht Khan in
    Delhi gave a stunning blow to the British. In Kanpur, Nana Sahib was proclaimed as the Peshwa and the brave leader
    Tantya Tope led his troops. Rani Lakshmibai was proclaimed the ruler of Jhansi who led her troops in the heroic
    battles with the British. The Hindus, the Muslims, the Sikhs and all the other brave sons of India fought shoulder
    to shoulder to throw out the British. The revolt was controlled by the British within one year, it began from Meerut
    on 10 May 1857 and ended in Gwalior on 20 June 1858.

<h3>End of the East India Company</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/download (7).jpg" alt="End of the East India Company"
    style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 200px;">
<p>Consequent to the failure of the Revolt of 1857 rebellion, one also saw the end of the East India Company's rule in
    India and many important changes took place in the British Government's policy towards India which sought to
    strengthen the British rule through winning over the Indian princes, the chiefs and the landlords. QueenVictoria's
    Proclamation of November 1, 1858 declared that thereafter India would be governed by and in the name of the British
    Monarch through a Secretary of State.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>The Non-Cooperation Movement</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/download (8).jpg" alt="The Non-Cooperation Movement"
    style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 200px;">
<p>The Non-Cooperation Movement was pitched in under leadership of Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress from
    September 1920 to February 1922, marking a new awakening in the Indian Independence Movement. After a series of
    events including the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Gandhiji realised that there was no prospect of getting any fair
    treatment at the hands of British, so he planned to withdraw the nation's co-operation from the British Government,
    thus launching the Non-Cooperation Movement and thereby marring the administrative set up of the country. This
    movement was a great success as it got massive encouragement to millions of Indians. This movement almost shook the
    British authorities.</p>
<br><br>
<h3>Quit India Movement</h3>
<img src="IMAGES/download (9).jpg" alt="Quit India Movement" style="margin: 40px; width: 360px; height: 200px;">
<p>In August 1942, Gandhiji started the 'Quit India Movement' and decided to launch a mass civil disobedience movement
    'Do or Die' call to force the British to leave India. The movement was followed, nonetheless, by large-scale
    violence directed at railway stations, telegraph offices, government buildings, and other emblems and institutions
    of colonial rule. There were widespread acts of sabotage, and the government held Gandhi responsible for these acts
    of violence, suggesting that they were a deliberate act of Congress policy. However, all the prominent leaders were
    arrested, the Congress was banned and the police and army were brought out to suppress the movement.</p>
