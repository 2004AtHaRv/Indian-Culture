    <h1>Dances of India</h1>
    <p>India is a land of diversities. Various climatic conditions have made India a diverse country. In all spheres of
        Indian life diversities are clearly visible. These diversities have made the Indian culture a unique one. Like
        all other aspects of life, the dance forms of India are also varied and different. There are many types of dance
        forms in India, from those which are deeply religious in content to those which are performed on small
        occasions.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Indian dances are broadly divided into Classical dances and folk dances. The Classical dances of India are
        usually spiritual in content. Though the folk dances of India are also spiritual and religious in content but
        the main force behind the folk dances of India is the celebratory mood. Dances are a form of coherent expression
        of human feelings. Like the Indian culture, Indian classical dances are equally diverse in nature. There are
        numerous classical dance forms in India and innumerable folk dances. Each dance form can be traced to different
        parts of the country. Each form represents the culture and ethos of a particular region or a group of people
        <br>
        <br>
        The most popular classical dance styles of India are Bharatnatyam of Tamil Nadu, Kathakali and Mohiniattam of
        Kerala, Odissi of Orissa, Kathak of Uttar Pradesh, Kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh and Manipuri of Manipur.</p>

                <h2>Bharatnatyam</h2>
                <h3>Bharatnatyam Dance is considered to be over 2000 years old. Bharatnatyam dance is known to be
                    ekaharya,
                    where one dancer takes on many roles in a single performance. In the early 19th century, the famous
                    Tanjore Quartette, under the patronage of Raja Serfoji are said to have been responsible for the
                    repertoire of Bharatnatyam dance as we see it today. The style was kept alive by the devadasis, who
                    were
                    young girls 'gifted' by their parents to the temples and who were married to the gods. The devadasis
                    performed music and dance as offerings to the deities, in the temple courtyards. On the gopurams of
                    the
                    Chidambaram temple, one can see a series of Bharatnatyam poses, frozen in stone as it were, by the
                    sculptor.</h3>

                <h2>Kathak</h2>
                <h3>The word Kathak has been derived from the word Katha which means a story. Kathakars or
                    story-tellers, are people who narrate stories largely based on episodes from the epics, myths and
                    legends. What perhaps started as an oral tradition, later incorporated mime and gestures, to make
                    the recitation more effective. Thus evolved a simple form of expressional dance, providing the
                    origins of what later developed into Kathak as we see it today.</h3>

                <h2>Kathakali</h2>
                <h3>Kerala is the home of several traditional dance and dance - drama forms, the most notable being
                    Kathakali. Kathakali is an art which has evolved from many social and religious theatrical forms
                    which existed in the southern region in ancient times. Chakiarkoothu, Koodiyattam, Krishnattam and
                    Ramanattam are few of the ritual performing arts of Kerala which have had a direct influence on
                    Kathakali in its form and technique. Legend has it that the refusal of the Zamorin of Calicut to
                    send his Krishnattam troupe to Travancore, so enraged the Raja of Kottarakkara, that he was inspired
                    to compose the Ramanattam. In the temple sculptures in Kerala and the frescoes in the Mattancheri
                    temple of approximately the 16th century, Kathakali dance scenes can be seen.</h3>

                <h2>Kuchipudi</h2>
                <h3>Kuchipudi is one of the classical styles of Indian dance. The art form takes its name from the
                    village of the birth, in the Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh. In the 17th century Kuchipudi style
                    of Yakshagaana was conceived by Siddhendra Yogi. It is said that Siddhendra Yogi had a dream in
                    which Lord Krishna asked him to compose a dancedrama based on the myth of the bringing of paarijaata
                    flower for Sathyabhaama, the most beloved queen of Krishna. In compliance with this command
                    Siddhendra Yogi composed the Bhaamaakalaapam. The progenitor of the form, presented a dance-drama
                    with young boys from the village. To show the dexterity of the dancers in footwork and their control
                    and balance over their bodies, techniques like dancing on the rim of a brass plate and with a
                    pitcher full of water on the head was introduced. By the middle of this century, Kuchipudi fully
                    crystallized as a separate classical solo dance style.</h3>

                <h2>Manipuri</h2>
                <h3>Manipuri, one of the main styles of Indian Classical Dances, originated in the picturesque and
                    secluded state of Manipur in the north-eastern corner of India. The origin of Manipuri dance can be
                    traced back to ancient times. The dance is associated with rituals and traditional festivals, with
                    legendary references to the dances of Shiva and Parvati and other gods and goddesses. Manipur dance
                    has a large repertoire, however, the most popular forms are the Ras, the Sankirtana and the
                    Thang-Ta. It was in the reign of King Bhagyachandra, in the 18th century, that the popular Rasleela
                    dances of Manipur originated. It is said, that the King conceived this complete dance form along
                    with its unique costume and music in a dream. In Manipuri Ras, the main characters are Radha,
                    Krishna and the gopis. Today, Manipur has an evolved and sophisticated repertoire of martial dances,
                    the dancers use swords, spears and shields. Real fight</h3>

                <h2>Odissi</h2>
                <h3>Odisha, on the eastern sea coast, is the home of Odissi, one of the many forms of Indian classical
                    dance. Sensuous and lyrical, Odissi is a dance of love and passion touching on the divine and the
                    human, the sublime and the mundane. Archaeological evidence of this dance form dating back to the
                    2nd century B.C. is found in the caves of Udayagiri and Khandagiri near Bhubaneshwar. For centuries,
                    maharis, the temple dancers, were the chief repositories of this dance. The dancer is adorned in
                    elaborate Odiya silver jewellery and a special hair-do. In each performance, even a modern Odissi
                    dancer still reaffirms the faith of the devadasis or maharis where they sought liberation or moksha
                    through the medium of dance.</h3>

                    mythology, is the classical solo dance form of Kerala. According to a Puranic story, Lord Vishnu
                    took on the guise of a ‘Mohini’ to seduce the Asuras, both in connection with churning of the ocean
                    and episode of the slaying of Bhasmasura. It traces its origin to the temples of Kerala.
                    Mohiniyattam is characterized by graceful, swaying body movements. It belongs to the lasya style
                    which is feminine, tender and graceful. The delicate body movements are emphasized by the glides and
                    the up and down movement on toes, like the waves of the sea and the swaying of the coconut, palm
                    trees and the paddy fields.</h3>
