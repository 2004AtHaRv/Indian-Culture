    <h1>Indian Food Culture</h1>
    <p>Indian food is different from rest of the world not only in taste but also in cooking methods. It reflects a
        perfect
        blend of various cultures and ages. Just like Indian culture, food in India has also been influenced by various
        civilizations, which have contributed their share in its overall development and the present form.
        Foods of India are better known for its spiciness. Throughout India, be it North India or South India, spices
        are
        used generously in food. But one must not forget that every single spice used in Indian dishes carries some or
        the
        other nutritional as well as medicinal properties.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>North Indian Food</h2>
    <p>Food in the north India, to begin with, Kashmiri cuisines reflect strong Central Asian influences. In Kashmir,
        mostly
        all the dishes are prepared around the main course of rice found abundantly in the beautiful valley. Another
        delicious item cooked here is the ‘Saag’ that is prepared with a green leafy vegetable known as the ‘Hak’.</p>
    <div class="slider"></div>
    <p>But on the other hand states like the Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh show high consumption of chapatis as
        staple
        food. Again, these chapatis are prepared with a variety of flours such as wheat, rice, maida, besan etc. Besides
        chapatis other closely related breads baked in these regions include Tandoori, Rumaali and Naan etc. However in
        the
        northern region impact of Mughlai food is quite obvious.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>West Indian Food</h2>
    <p>In western India, the desert cuisine is famous for its unique taste and varieties of food. Rajasthan and Gujarat
        are
        the states that represent the dessert flavor of Indian food. Here an immense variety of dals and achars
        (pickles/preserves) is used that simply substitutes the relative lack of fresh vegetables in these areas.
        In the states like Maharashtra, the food is usually a mix of both north as well as south cooking styles. Here
        people
        use both the rice and the wheat with same interest.</p>
    <div class="slider1"></div>
    <p>Along the coastline of Mumbai a wide variety of fishes is available. Some of the delicious preparations include
        dishes like the Bombay Prawn and Pompfret.
        In Goa, that is further down towards south, one can notice Portuguese influence in the cooking style as well as
        in
        the dishes. Some of the major dishes of this region are the sweet and sour Vindaloo, duck baffad, sorpotel and
        egg
        molie etc.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>East Indian Food</h2>
    <p>In the eastern India, the Bengali and Assamese styles of cooking are noticeable. The staple food of Bengalis is
        the
        yummy combination of rice and fish. Usually the Bengalis love eating varieties of fishes. A special way of
        preparing
        the delicacy known as ‘Hilsa’ is by wrapping it in the pumpkin leaf and then cooking it.</p>
    <div class="slider2"></div>
    <p>Another unusual ingredient that is commonly used in the Bengali cooking is the ‘Bamboo Shoot’. Various sweets
        prepared in this region, by using milk include the ‘Roshogollas’, ‘Sandesh’, ‘Cham-cham’ and many more.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>South Indian Food</h2>
    <p>In the southern India, the states make great use of spices, fishes and coconuts, as most of them have coastal
        kitchens. In the foods of Tamil Nadu use of tamarind is frequently made in order to impart sourness to the
        dishes.
        It simply distinguishes the Tamil Food from other cuisines.</p>
    <div class="slider3"></div>
    <p>The cooking style of Andhra Pradesh is supposed to make excessive use of chilies, which is obviously to improve
        the
        taste of the dishes.In Kerala, some of the delicious dishes are thelamb stew and appams, Malabar fried prawns,
        Idlis, Dosas, fish molie and rice puttu. Another famous item of this region is the sweetened coconut milk. Yet
        another dish is Puttu, which is glutinous rice powder steamed like a pudding in a bamboo shoot.</p>
