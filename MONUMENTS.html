<h1>Indian Monuments</h1>
<p style="color: #d81e5b;">With their elaborate superfluities and wonderful architecture, Indian monuments represent one
    of the most
    outstanding facets of the multi-faceted Indian culture. An architectural feat in itself, each Indian monument is a
    remarkably splendid sample of unbelievable artistry, covering a sense of mystery, deception and romance. Be it the
    marvel in white marble, the spellbinding Taj Mahal; or the red stone splendor, the magnificent Red Fort; or the
    magnificence of temple art of Khajuraho, Konark and Hampi , there is evident the master craftsmanship and elegance,
    that brings to the forefront the splendor of the bygone era. Monuments are witnesses of India's past; the monuments
    of India are also the guardian pillars of India's cultural heritage. The monuments of India have become an
    inspiration for the future generations.</p>
