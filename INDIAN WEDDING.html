    <h1>Indian Weddings</h1>
    <p>Weddings in India vary according to the region, the religion, the community and the personal preferences of the
        bride and groom. They are festive occasions in India, and in most cases celebrated with extensive decorations,
        colour, music, dance, costumes and rituals that depend on the community, region and religion of the bride and
        the groom, as well as their preferences. India celebrates about 10 million weddings per year, of which about 80%
        are Hindu weddings.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Ceremonies</h2>
    <p>While there are many festival-related rituals in Hinduism, vivaah (wedding) is the most extensive personal ritual
        an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life. Typical Hindu families spend significant effort and financial
        resources to prepare and celebrate weddings. The rituals and process of a Hindu wedding vary depending on region
        of India, local adaptations, resources of the family and preferences of the bride and the groom. Nevertheless,
        there are a few key rituals common in Hindu weddings – Kanyadaan, Panigrahana, and Saptapadi; these are
        respectively, gifting away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify
        impending union, and taking seven steps before fire with each step including a set of mutual vows. After the
        seventh step and vows of Saptapadi, the couple is legally husband and wife. Jain and Buddhist weddings in India,
        share many themes, but are centered around their respective religious ideas and texts.</p>
    <br>

    <br>
    <h2>Other religions</h2>
    <p><b style="color: white;">Sikhs</b> get married through a ceremony called Anand Karaj, a ritual started by the
        third leader of Sikhism,
        Guru Amar Das. The couple walk around the holy book, the Guru Granth Sahib four times.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: white;">Indian Muslims</b> celebrate a traditional Islamic wedding following customs similar to
        those practiced in
        the Middle East. The rituals include Nikah, payment of financial dower called Mahr by the groom to the bride,
        signing of marriage contract, and a reception.[9]
        <br>
        <br>
        <b style="color: white;">Indian Christian</b> weddings follow customs similar to those practiced in the
        Christian countries in the
        West in states like Goa but have more Indian customs in other states. The couple meet in the presence of a
        minister, often in a church or place of worship. Readings from the Bible take place. The bride and groom take
        their marriage vows. The bride and groom often exchange rings as a sign of their endless love.

    <h2>Marriage age</h2>
    <p>In the past, the age of marriage was young. The average age of marriage for women in India has increased to 21
        years, according to 2011 Census of India. In 2009, about 7% of women got married before the age of 18. Arranged
        marriages have long been the norm in Indian society. Even today, the majority of Indians have their marriages
        planned by their parents and other respected family members. Recent studies suggest that Indian culture is
        trending away from traditional arranged marriages. Fewer marriages are purely arranged without consent and that
        the majority of surveyed Indian marriages are arranged with consent. The percentage of self-arranged marriages
        (called love marriages in India) have also increased vastly, particularly in the urban parts of India.</p>
