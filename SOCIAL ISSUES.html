    <h1>Social Issues</h1>
    <h2>The Indian society is the complex amalgamation of diverse cultures. Barriers of religions, language and
        traditions divide its people into innumerable sects and sometimes lead to incompatibility. Numerous instances of
        foreign invasions have let to plundering of its rich natural resources, plunging the country not only into
        economic downfall, but also causing hindrance to education and reforms. The two hundred years long oppressive
        British rule has in a way brought the country on the brink of social collapse that the citizens are still
        fighting after 69 years of Independence.
        <br>
        <br>
        Issues like population explosion leads to divergence of other socio-economic problems like poverty and
        unemployment. Lack of education and ignorance prevailing in rural areas are the reasons why issues like gender
        inequality, feticide and child labor have been prevailing since decades. It creates this vicious cycle of
        challenges that seem impossible to tackle. Incidents of violence against women and children and exploitative
        nature of the society in this aspect is a direct aftermath of the deep-rooted patriarchy. Social evils like the
        caste system, child marriage and dowry system act as huge deterrents towards the overall development of India.
        India is periodically plagued by a a host of religious, political and regional unrests that exerts intensely
        harmful effect on society as well as economy of the country. Moreover, owing to globalization, these issues
        garner a lot of negative media attention from all over the world. As a consequence of these social issues
        continuing, India is still to find universal credibility in international forums.
        <br>
        <br>
        To brand India as this truly developing nation, Indians need to take up eradication of these issues as their
        champion cause. Awareness is the first step towards addressing any social cause. For individuals to know the
        negative impacts of his actions that he so easily inflicts in the name of tradition is the foundation upon which
        remedial recourses can be built.</h2>

                <p class="card-excerpt">Sati or Suttee is a banned funeral custom, where a widow either voluntarily
                    or by compulsion self-immolates (Anumarana or Anugamana) on her husband’s pyre, or commits
                    suicide in some other manner, following her husband’s death. It is regarded to have emerged from
                    the warrior aristocracy in the northern Indian subcontinent and later found ground in many areas
                    in Southeast Asia. Unrelenting campaigns of reformers like Ram Mohan Roy and William Carey led
                    to ban of Sati in India starting from the passage of Bengal Sati Regulation in 1829. Later, the
                    Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987, was enacted that prohibits any kind of aid, encouragement, and
                    glorifying the practice of sati.</p>

                <p class="card-excerpt">As Mahatma Gandhi quoted, ‘Sanitation is more important than Independence,’
                    ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ or ‘Clean India Mission’ is a campaign that aims at cleaning up roads,
                    infrastructures, streets, rural areas, smaller towns and cities of the country. The primary
                    motive of ‘Clean India Mission’ is to uproot the open defecation by constructing community-owned
                    and household-owned toilets. It also aims at building a mechanism that can monitor toilet use.

                <p class="card-excerpt">The Indian society is socio-politically stratified. Caste system has
                    prevailed for ages and arranges the people into social strata or classes. Though this system is
                    similar to the concept of racism that prevails in western countries where people are
                    discriminated on the basis of their skin color, in India, people are socially differentiated on
                    the basis of tribe, region, class, and religion. This means that when a child is born their
                    status on the social hierarchy gets fixed on the basis of the caste he/she is born into. Caste
                    system becomes an obstruction in the growth of the people and nation.</p>

                    lead the establishment and expansion of international trade to Asia and subsequently leading to
                    economic and political domination of the entire Indian subcontinent. It all started when the
                    East India Company, or the “Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading with the East
                    Indies”, as it was originally named, obtained a Royal Charter from Queen Elizabeth I, granting
                    it “monopoly at the trade with the East”. A joint stock company, shares owned primarily by
                    British merchants and aristocrats, the East India Company had no direct link to the British
                    government.</p>

                    a prominent figure only in 1916 but by 1919 he emerged as one of the most significant national
                    leaders. His unique political thoughts, which arose from his spiritual beliefs, changed Indian
                    politics and went on to play a significant role in awakening the political consciousness of the
                    common masses. Many subsequent movements launched under his leadership centered on his main
                    political ideologies of Satyagraha and Ahimsa, and played an important role in uniting people to
                    fight for India’s independence.

                    socio-economic shackles of dependency and deprivations. Often made synonymous to gender
                    equality, the term women empowerment encompasses a much larger set of principles that needs
                    whole-hearted attention. Empowerment of
                    women would mean encouraging women to be self-reliant, economically independent, have positive
                    self-esteem, generate confidence to face any difficult situation and incite active participation
                    in various socio-political development endeavors.

                <p class="card-excerpt">If the word demands a definition, “unemployment”, may be elaborated as a
                    state of not finding work by an individual who is fit and willing to work. It is usually
                    measured in percentage; the number of individuals without work out of the total “labour force”
                    of the country or specific social groups. Labour force is the term collectively applied to the
                    total number of individuals within the population who are willing and capable of doing work.

                    social welfare organizations is critical here as it is not possible for the government to reach
