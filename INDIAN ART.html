    <h2 id="Indian Painters">Indian Painters</h2>
    <p>Indian subcontinent is famous for being the home country of a large number of exceptionally brilliant artists,
        including painters, writers, singers, etc. The art of painting in India dates back to the ancient times, as is
        evident from the cave paintings of Ajanta and Ellora. Many painters of India have received global recognition
        also and their paintings have fetched millions of dollars in international auctions. From the paintings
        revolving around religious topics to the abstract ones, Indian painters have covered almost each and every arena

    <h3>Abanindranath Tagore</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/Abanindranath_Tagore_photo.jpg" alt="Abanindranath Tagore"
        style=" margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Abanindranath Tagore, the nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, was one of the most prominent artists of India. He was
        the first major supporter of swadeshi values in Indian art. Abanindranath first created the ‘Indian Society of
        Oriental Art’ and later went on to establish Bengal school of art. His sole aim for establishing the school was
        to counter the English influence on Indian artists. He did that by incorporating Indian elements in his works
        and achieved success whenBritish art institutions gave in and accepted to teach and propagate his style of works
        in their organizations. His idea of modernizing Mughal and Rajput paintings eventually gave rise to modern
        Indian painting, which took birth at his Bengal school of art. Abanindranath is also regarded as a proficient
        and accomplished writer. Most of his literary works were meant for children.Some of his books like ‘BudoAngla’,
        ‘KhirerPutul’ and ‘Rajkahini’ are best examples of Bengali children's literature.</h4>

    <h3>Amrita Sher-Gil</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/download (10).jpg" alt="Amrita Sher-Gil" style=" margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Often referred to as India's Frida Kahlo for aesthetically blending traditional and Western art forms, Amrita
        Sher-Gil was one of the most famous painters of India. She is also considered as a revolutionary woman artist
        and the originator of modern art in India. Though her artworks mainly depicted Western style and culture during
        the initial stages of her career, the painter gradually began to rediscover herself by depicting Indian subjects
        using traditional methods. Apart from painting, she was also well-versed in playing piano and fond of reading.
        She even travelled to different parts of India, France and Turkey and managed to incorporate ideas gained from
        different techniques into her own works. Throughout her career, she painted her friends, lovers and also made
        quite a few self-portraits, for which she is often considered as a narcissistic by many. </h4>

    <h3>Francis Newton Souza</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/Indian_artist_of_Goan_origin,_Francis_Newton_Souza.jpg" alt="Francis Newton Souza"
        style=" height: 320px; width: 480px; margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Francis Newton Souza, who often ridiculed hypocrites and the brutal acquisitive nature of the upper class
        through his magnificent paintings, is one of the most prominent yet often forgotten Indian painters. Marred by
        his own futuristic thinking and several troubled relationships, the founding member of Progressive Artists'
        Group of Bombay still managed to rise above his personal life to conquer the hearts of many through his works.
        He was one among a few post-independence Indian painters who had managed to gain respect and recognition in the
        West. The West had to be his professional haven, for his works were often bold, depicting nude women and
        societal criticisms, which would have perhaps annihilated his painting career, had he created them in the East.
        He often experimented with his mediums and mixed chemicals with his paints to come up with a unique end result.
        He was also probably the first Indian painter to have used acrylic paint in as early as the 1960s. Though his
        paintings did not receive the kind of monetary attention that they deserved during his lifetime, they however,
        were sold for colossal prices at various auctions post his death. Today, his paintings adorn the walls of many
        museums all over the world.</h4>

    <br>
    <h3>Jamini Roy</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/Jaminiroy.jpg" alt="Jamini Roy" style=" margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Walk into an average middle-class art-loving household of West Bengal, and chances are that you might come
        across a well-preserved portrait of Jamini Roy rather than a fancy looking artwork of one of India’s many modern
        artists. The paintings had to be well-preserved, for Jamini Roy would not have sold his work, had he doubted his
        buyer’s passion for art. While most of the Indian painters of the 20th Century were excited about modern art,
        which fetched them good returns, Jamini Roy stood out for his love towards Indian roots. His passion for simple
        Indian folk art was such that he did not care about selling his works for fancy prices and only sold them for as
        little as 350 rupees. And he would buy back his works, should he find out that his paintings are maintained
        poorly by the buyer. Influenced by the simplicity of Kalighat paintings (Indian folk art), Jamini Roy gave up on
        modern art and stuck to his roots, winning millions of hearts in the process. He also gave up on using European
        paints and even canvases to replace them with suitable alternatives. In 1954, the Government of India honored
        him with Padma Bhushan for his contribution towards art.</h4>

    <h3>M.F. Hussain</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/MFHussain2.jpg" alt="M.F. Hussain"
        style=" margin: 20px; height: 320px; width: 240px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Maqbool Fida Husain was one of the most famous artists of India, known all over the world for his amazing
        paintings that he created during his lifetime. So huge is the popularity of his paintings that M. F. Husain was
        called the 'Picasso of India' by the Forbes magazine. Husain was largely responsible in modernizing Indian art
        as he was one of the most influential founding members of Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. During the course
        of his splendid career, Husain also tried his hand at printmaking, photography and filmmaking. Some of the films
        which he directed met with critical success. Apart from receiving the prestigious National Film Award under Best
        Experimental Film for his movie ‘Through the Eyes of a Painter’, he also made ‘Gaja Gamini’ and ‘Meenaxi: A Tale
        of Three Cities’. The latter was screened and appreciated at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Though he was a
        celebrated and respected painter, Husain met with heavy criticisms during the final phases of his career. The
        criticisms flew in for his nude depictions of Hindu goddesses, which ultimately forced him to seek asylum in
        countries like Qatar and England. Husain never made it back to his motherland and the debates surrounding his
        exile continued for many days even after his demise.</h4>

    <h3>Rabindranath Tagore</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/Rabindranath-Tagore.jpg" alt="Rabindranath Tagore"
        style=" margin: 20px; width: 360px; height: 320px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Rabindranath Tagore, who composed the National Anthem of India and won the Nobel Prize for Literature, was a
        multitalented personality in every sense. He was a Bengali poet, Brahmo Samaj philosopher, visual artist,
        playwright, novelist, painter and a composer. He was also a cultural reformer who modified Bengali art by
        rebuffing the strictures that confined it within the sphere of classical Indian forms. Though he was a polymath,
        his literary works alone are enough to place him in the elite list of all-time greats. Even today, Rabindranath
        Tagore is often remembered for his poetic songs, which are both spiritual and mercurial. He was one of those
        great minds, ahead of his time, and that is exactly why his meeting with Albert Einstein is considered as a
        clash between science and spirituality. Tagore was keen in spreading his ideologies to the rest of the world and
        hence embarked on a world tour, lecturing in countries like Japan and the United States. Soon, his works were
        admired by people of various countries and he eventually became the first non-European to win a Nobel Prize.
        Apart from Jana Gana Mana (the National Anthem of India), his composition ‘Amar Shonar Bangla’ was adopted as
        the National Anthem of Bangladesh and the National Anthem of Sri Lanka was inspired by one of his works.</h4>

    <h3>Raja Ravi Varma</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/Ravivarma1b.jpg" alt="Raja Ravi Varma" style=" margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>Raja Ravi Varma was an Indian painter and artist, considered as one of the greatest painters in the history of
        Indian art. Raja Ravi Varma is known for his amazing paintings, which revolve mainly around the Puranas (ancient
        mythological stories) and thegreat Indian epics - Mahabharata and Ramayana. Ravi Varma is one of the few
        painters who managed to accomplish a beautiful union of Indian traditionwith the techniques of European academic
        art. This is one of the reasons why he is considered as one of the most, if not the most prominent Indian
        painters. Varma was also responsible in taking the Indian art all over the world with his impeccable technique.
        While the Europeans and other art lovers admired his technique, the laymen of India enjoyed his work for its
        simplicity. More often than not, Varma’s paintings highlighted the beauty of South Indian women which were
        admired by all. His portrayal of Hindu gods and goddesses went on to become worship material for many people
        belonging to the lower castes. Back then, these people were often forbidden from entering temples and thus they
        celebrated Varma's works, for they gave them an idea of how the deities looked inside the temple. He also
        managed to improve the artistic knowledge and spread the importance of art among Indian people. He achieved this
        by making affordable lithographs, which were accessible even to the poor. Alternatively, this also made him a
        household name and Raja Ravi Varma soon captured the hearts of all. Recognizing his feat, Viceroy Lord Curzon
        honored him with the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal for his service in thefurtherance of public interest.</h4>

    <h3>S. H. Raza</h3>
    <img src="IMAGES/download (11).jpg" alt="S. H. Raza" style=" margin: 20px; margin-right: 30px; float: right;">
    <h4>One of the most distinguished artists of the Indian subcontinent, Sayed Haider Raza, simply known as S.H. Raza,
        is famous for his usage of rich colors in all his portrays. Though he settled down in France in the early 1950s,
        he continued to represent Indian art by incorporating Indian philosophy and Indian cosmology in his works.
        Throughout his career, he had mainly used oil and acrylics for his paintings, which highlighted Indian
        ethnography. He also incorporated the Indian concepts of space and time, which was a huge hit among French,
        Indian and other art lovers worldwide. In 2010, a seminal work of his titled ‘Saurashtra’ was sold at a
        Christie's auction for an impressive $3,486,965 (Rs. 16.42 crore), making him one of the priciest modern artists
        of India. For his immense contribution in the field of art, S.H. Raza was honored with India’s second highest
        civilian award, Padma Vibhushan in the year 2013. </h4>

    <p>The tradition of painting has been carried on in the Indian subcontinent since the ancient times. Standing as a
        testimony to this fact are the exquisite murals of Ajanta and Ellora, Buddhist palm leaf manuscripts, Mughal and
        Kangra schools of miniature Indian paintings, etc. Infact, records have been found that indicate the usage of
        paintings for decorating the doorways, guest rooms, etc. Some traditional Indian paintings, like those of
        Ajanta, Bagh and Sittanvasal, depict a love for nature and its forces.
        <br>
        <br>
        With time, Indian classical paintings evolved to become a sort of blend of the various traditions influencing
        them. Even the folk painting of India has become quite popular amongst art lovers, both at the national as well
        as the international level. Most of the folk paintings reflect a heavy influence of the local customs and
        traditions.</p>
