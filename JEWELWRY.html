    family. They are a part of the purification ritual as she becomes a part of the extended family of her bridegroom.
    Indians give importance to the nuances of bridal jewelries. The heavier the nuances of these jewelries are, the
    bigger role they play in the legacy of the family and the jewelry itself. So before giving the jewelries to the
    bride, the family often makes sure that they are heavy with more distinct designs.

    Gods and Goddesses in Hinduism. Wearing these jewelries signifies that you are asking for protection from these
    divine beings. It also a way of asking blessing.
